To obtain the information on a phone number (e.g.: country, area, block,
subscriber number, type of line, carrier name, etc) you can send the number to
this API endpoint. The service will cleanse the number according to every
country dialing plan and will output the information or will error out with
ERROR_INVALID_NUMBER and its reason.
